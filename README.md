Student Management API


This API allows you to manage student data, with operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting students. Additionally, it integrates with an external service to generate a profile summary for each student.

Features
Create Student: Add a new student with details like name, age, and email.
Get All Students: Retrieve a list of all students.
Get Student by ID: Fetch details of a student using their ID.
Update Student by ID: Update details of an existing student.
Delete Student by ID: Remove a student by their ID.
Generate Summary: Generate a summary for a student profile.
Endpoints
POST /students: Create a new student.
GET /students: Retrieve all students.
GET /students/{id}: Get student by ID.
PUT /students/{id}: Update student by ID.
DELETE /students/{id}: Delete student by ID.
GET /students/summary/{id}: Generate or retrieve a summary for the student by ID.

Concurrency and Data Storage

Add further validation for data inputs and error handling.
